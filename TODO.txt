* Sat Nov 26 12:09 2016: CONVERT ALL utf8.RuneError by EOL var

* Fri Oct 28 00:19 2016: Fix or make comment describing purpose of

		// FIXME: What does this do?

* Thu Oct 27 23:38 2016: Fix NO NEED FOR FOR LOOP HERE

  more efficient then peek and won't require saving lexer state. We should benchmark to see it if improves performance.

* Tue Oct 25 19:56 2016: Split up lex.go and parse.go

  These files are getting really long.

* Sat Oct 22 13:55 2016: Bad tests should match good test in number (i.e., 01.00.00.00) and following this naming pattern:

  01.00.00.00-target-missing-backquote-bad-items-xx.json

* Thu Oct 20 00:41 2016: CURRENTLY WORKING ON FINISHING GOOD TESTS FOR INLINE MARKUP

* Thu Oct 20 00:42 2016: add -json argument to gb test -v parse to output to JSON

  Parse nodes and expected nodes see parse_test.go#450

* Mon Oct 17 22:33 2016: Refactor InlineInterpretedText to InlineInterpretedTextNode

* Sun Oct 16 22:02 2016: Add strong across lines test

  **Strong is
  across lines!**

* Tue Oct 11 00:10 2016: Document creating new tests

  The UltiSnips Snippets should be mentioned.

* Mon Feb 29 13:49 2016: Add XX to beginning of test files that are not implmented yet

* Mon Oct 10 19:35 2016: DOCUMENT DEBUGGING TRICKS

* Mon Oct 10 17:53 2016: sectionLevels.Add() should do one thing

  In parse.go#399 a section is added or existing is returned. We should rename this function from Add() to AddOrReuse() for
  self documentation.

* Mon Oct 10 01:44 2016: Need to add blockquote levels

  Like sectionLevels, but for blockquotes. Currently set to use a hack so I can get all the tests to pass.

  Try to make indentQueue more general; perhaps we can use it for blockquotes as well as bullet lists.

* Mon Oct 10 01:27 2016: Debug output should be more like the rst2psuedo command

  I like how this debug output prints the current line and what state the state machine is in. We should use something
  similar.

  Example:

  rst2pseudoxml testdata/03-test-section/03.00.04.00-section-bad-unexpected-titles.rst --debug

* Sun Jul 17 14:42 2016: Add flag to test binary to select lexer or parser debug output

* Sun Apr 10 11:16 2016: debug log should include line number and function name (context)

* Sun Feb 14 22:38 2016: Fix https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/demizer/go-rst

* Fri Feb 19 23:52 2016: Rename *Node to Node* in node.go

* Sat Feb 20 01:10 2016: Should we convert char12 and vert tab to spaces before proccessing?

  From the spec:

  Other whitespace characters (form feeds [chr(12)] and vertical tabs [chr(11)]) are converted to single spaces before processing.

* Sun Feb 28 09:00 2016: renumber-items.sh should only take the test name, it should intelligently find the test and
  renumber.

* Sun Feb 28 09:21 2016: If I run a lex test directly then "startPosition" is set to 0. It should always be specified in the
  items.

* Sun Feb 28 09:26 2016: Refactor parse.go Tree, move it's really big.

* Mon Feb 29 13:59 2016: Implement blockquote tests
