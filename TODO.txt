* Tue Oct 11 00:10 2016: add a document listing the un-implemented tests

  - DONE - Files with -xx in the names in testdata are tests that are not-implemented. Publish a link in README.rst in the
    How to help section.

  - Finish writing how to implement an element (and test)

    * The UltiSnips Snippets should be mentioned with snippets published to the repo.

    * Document debugging tips

* Sun Feb 26 14:09 2017: Convert test checks to use testify package

* Sat Feb 20 01:10 2016: Should we convert char12 and vert tab to spaces before proccessing?

  From the spec:

  Other whitespace characters (form feeds [chr(12)] and vertical tabs [chr(11)]) are converted to single spaces before processing.

  - Complete whitespace handling. See the first three items in the implementation status doc

* Sun Feb 14 22:38 2016: Fix gocyclo on https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/demizer/go-rst

* Sun Jun 11 11:03 2017: Get coverage reports above 95%

* Thu Oct 20 00:41 2016: IMPLEMENT GOOD TESTS FOR INLINE MARKUP

* Mon Oct 10 17:53 2016: sectionLevels.Add() should be renamed to AddOrReuse()

  In section.go#145 a section is added or existing is returned. We should rename this function from Add() to AddOrReuse() for
  self documentation.

* Mon Oct 10 01:44 2016: Need to add blockquote levels

  Like sectionLevels, but for blockquotes. Currently set to use a hack so I can get all the tests to pass.

  Try to make indentQueue more general; perhaps we can use it for blockquotes as well as bullet lists.

* Mon Oct 10 01:27 2016: Debug output should be more like the rst2psuedo command

  I like how this debug output prints the current line and what state the state machine is in. We should use something
  similar.

  Example:

  rst2pseudoxml testdata/04-test-section/02-bad/04.00.04.00-unexpected-titles.rst --debug
